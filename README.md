This is my personal portfolio crafted with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), utilizing the architecture of [Feature-Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/docs/get-started/overview). The projects are dynamically fetched using the GitHub API. Additionally, the 3D models showcased in the portfolio are obtained from Sketchfab, licensed freely, and rendered seamlessly in the browser through [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).
